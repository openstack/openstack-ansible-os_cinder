prelude: >
    In order to support efforts on aligning Cinder service type naming across
    various deployments and move on from version-specific service type to a
    generic one, a Cinder service will be named as ``block-storage`` from
    now on, which will be reflected in Keystone service catalog and endpoints.
    Please check upgrade notes for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    In order to align with recommendations on Cinder service naming, os_cinder
    role will introduce a new service in catalog named ``cinder`` of type
    ``block-storage`` and corresponding set of endpoints representing them.
    Upgrade script will create a new file `/etc/openstack_deploy/user_epoxy_upgrade.yml`
    with defining ``cinder_service_v3_enabled: true`` which aims to keep old
    version-based service type and endpoints intact.
    If you want to remove old versioned-based endpoints and service type from
    catalog you may simply undefine that variable, as it is ``False`` by
    default.

    All new deployments will not have ``cinderv3``/``volumev3``
    service unless ``cinder_service_v3_enabled: true`` is defined.
deprecations:
  - |
    In order to accomplish Cinder service naming alignment we had revised our
    prior decision on deprecating following variables, which was introduced
    previous cycle. Following variables should NOT be considered as
    deprecated anymore:

      - `cinder_service_description`
      - `cinder_service_publicuri_proto`
      - `cinder_service_adminuri_proto`
      - `cinder_service_internaluri_proto`
      - `cinder_service_type`
      - `cinder_service_publicuri`
      - `cinder_service_adminuri`
      - `cinder_service_internaluri`

  - |
    Usage of version-based (``cinderv3``/``volumev3``) endpoints and service
    type for Cinder is considered as a deprecated behaviour and will be removed
    in the future.
